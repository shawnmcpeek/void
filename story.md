Absolutely, Shawn. You’ve already built a strong mechanical core: flashlight-based tension, reactive enemies, and infinite progression. But if you’re feeling like it’s missing something, a narrative layer could elevate *The Void* from eerie survival to emotionally resonant experience. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ve got so far, followed by story ideas that could deepen the experience without bogging it down:

### 🧩 What We’ve Built So Far

- **Core Gameplay**:  
  - Infinite scroller through a graveyard path  
  - Flashlight is the only source of light  
  - Creatures react to illumination—too much exposure triggers death  
  - Player can angle flashlight left/right  
  - Goal: survive and progress as far as possible  

- **Visuals & Assets**:  
  - Top-down character sprites (male/female)  
  - Cone-shaped flashlight texture  
  - Graveyard setting with fog, ambient audio, and symbolic atmosphere

### 📖 Narrative Layers to Consider

#### 1. **Memory Fragments**
- As you progress, you occasionally pass ghostly silhouettes or objects that trigger short text overlays or audio whispers.
- These fragments hint at the player’s past—lost loved ones, regrets, or unfinished business.
- Could be randomized or tied to distance milestones.

#### 2. **The Lantern Keeper**
- A recurring spectral figure appears at intervals, offering cryptic advice or warnings.
- Could be a guide, antagonist, or even a reflection of the player.
- Adds mystery and a sense of progression.

#### 3. **Grave Markers with Lore**
- Every few hundred meters, pass a grave with a readable epitaph.
- Some are poetic, some unsettling, some personal.
- Slowly builds a picture of the world and its rules.

#### 4. **Evolving Environment**
- The graveyard subtly changes as you progress—more twisted trees, broken statues, glowing runes.
- Could reflect the player’s emotional state or narrative arc.

#### 5. **The Light’s Origin**
- Maybe the flashlight isn’t just a tool—it’s tied to the player’s soul, memories, or guilt.
- As you progress, the light flickers, changes color, or reveals hidden truths.

### 🧠 Optional Meta Layer

- **Distance = Redemption**  
  The farther you go, the more you “unravel” your past. Maybe reaching a certain point lets you “ascend” or “escape.”
  
- **Symbolic Enemies**  
  Each spirit represents a fear, regret, or memory. Their behavior reflects that—some chase, some mimic, some whisper.

- **Multiple Endings**  
  Based on how far you get, what fragments you uncover, and how you interact with the Lantern Keeper.

Would you like me to sketch out a sample progression arc or write a few epitaphs or memory fragments to test the tone? We can keep it subtle and symbolic, or go full psychological horror—your call.
